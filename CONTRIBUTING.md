# Contributing to Awesome ML for Scientists

Thank you for considering contributing! This list is specifically for **domain scientists** who need ML resources without enterprise budgets or ML engineering backgrounds.

## Guidelines

### What belongs here

- ✅ Free or affordable resources accessible to researchers
- ✅ Resources with good documentation for beginners
- ✅ Domain-specific ML tools for scientific research

### What doesn't belong

- ❌ Enterprise-focused MLOps tools
- ❌ Expensive services without academic pricing
- ❌ Unmaintained projects (no updates in 2+ years)
- ❌ Resources without documentation

### How to contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Add your resource** in the appropriate section
3. Use the format: `[Name](URL) - Brief description.`
4. Keep descriptions concise (one sentence)
5. **Submit a pull request** with a brief explanation of why this resource helps scientists

### Adding a new section

If your resource doesn't fit existing categories, propose a new section. New sections should:
- Serve a specific scientific domain or need
- Have at least 3 resources to start
- Be relevant to the target audience (domain scientists, not ML engineers)

### Quality standards

Before submitting, ask yourself:
- Would a scientist find this useful?
- Is the resource actively maintained?
- Is pricing transparent and reasonable for academic or grant budgets?

## Questions?

Open an issue if you're unsure whether something fits. We're happy to discuss!
